# How to re-ink a nylon ink ribbon  

Although various other instructions for re-inking ink ribbons are available on the web, the frequently recommended passive technique[^1] is not effective for nylon ribbons. The problem is that nylon absorbs only a little water[^2] and so, inking the ribbon requires actively spreading and working in the water-based ink[^3]. This article describes a way to re-ink your nylon ribbon using a brush to achieve uniform printing right from the start.  

### Materials:  

* Ribbon: a monochrome nylon typewriter ribbon  
* Ink: water based stamp pad ink. Black or another dark color is best  
* Soap and water for washing and clean up  
* Vegetable oil: some 5 - 10 drops eases cleaning ink from hands  
* Large pieces of paper or cardboard to cover work surface  
* Paper or napkins for ink clean up. Have plenty.  

### Tools:  

* Brush: a flat brush about 13 mm (1/2 in) wide with stiff bristles  
* Tile: a piece of flat, smooth porcelain or glass tile  
* Apron or old shirt: Ink can splatter. Do you really want to ruin that nice shirt?

### Tips  

* Review the instructions and prepare everything before starting  
* Work by a bright lamp or window so that you can see clearly  
* Avoid spills: *set the ink bottle away from the area where you are working with the brush and ribbon.* Add more drops of ink to the tile when you need it  

### Procedure  

#### Set up your work area  

1. On a flat, stable surface, clear an area approximately 60 cm x 60 cm (24 in x 24 in) and then cover the area with a few layers of paper or a large piece of cardboard. Paper materials will both protect the surface and absorb  the small ink spills that may occur while working  
2. Set out the tile, brush, ink bottle, and paper for clean up  

#### Inspect the ribbon and get it ready  

3. Remove the ribbon from the typewriter by removing the ribbon from the ribbon carrier and then lifting the spools up out of the spool carriers  
4. Inspect the ribbon: Wind the ribbon onto one spool. Look at the ribbon carefully as you wind it from the full spool onto the empty spool. Assure that the ribbon is in good condition from one end to the other (If any part of the ribbon is damaged, it's best to replace the ribbon).  
5. Place the full spool on the left hand side of the tile and the empty spool on the right hand side (Reverse this if you are left handed.) and make sure that the ribbon lays flat where it passes over the tile.  

#### Re-ink the ribbon  

6. Put 5 - 10 drops of ink on the tile about 20 mm (3/4 in) away from the ribbon  
7. Wet the tip of the brush with ink. Use your free hand to hold the full spool and apply the ink to the ribbon using firm brush strokes parallel to the length of the ribbon. Continue passing the brush over the ribbon until the ink is uniformly distributed. A well inked ribbon will appear damp and glossy, but not wet.  
8. Wind the re-inked part of the ribbon onto the right hand spool and repeat step 7 for each new section, adding more ink to the tile as needed.  
9. Fine tuning: Reverse the positions of the two ribbon spools and firmly pass the brush several times over each section of ribbon. Assure that the ink is applied evenly with no wet or dry areas. Work from one end of the ribbon to the other.  

* If an area of the ribbon is too wet: clean the bristles of the brush on dry paper and then pass the tip of the brush over the wet area to absorb the excess ink.  
* If an area of ribbon is too dry: first, place the tip of the brush on the adjacent damp area and pull with firm pressure towards the dry area. Repeat this process until the ink is uniformly distributed. If the area remains too dry, wet the brush with a small amount of ink and apply.  

#### Clean up  

1. Start with paper. Wiping with paper will clean up most of the ink from the brush, the bobbins, the tile, the ink bottle, your hands and anything non-porous you accidentally touched.  
2. Install the ribbon in the typewriter.  
3. Pick up your work area.  
4. Wash up. Apply a few drops of the oil to the ink stains on your hands, rub the oil in well and then wipe off your hands with paper. Para terminar, wash your hands with soap and water.  

Congratulations! It's time to try out that typewriter!
